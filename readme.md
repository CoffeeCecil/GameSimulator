This is a game initiative simulator.
It runs around the initiative engine, a simple test character
and logic that is stored in dictionary like objects i.

The proof of the final run, is mainly that it runs as expected, since it has a number of random events attached to it.

The simulation as well as a number of unittests are triggered by running
"python3 test.py"
